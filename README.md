# Mile High Motherplants Website

This is a simple static website for Mile High Motherplants, a Colorado-based cannabis clone nursery with a playful Mothership theme. The site is built with HTML and CSS and is designed to be hosted for free using GitHub Pages.

## Files

- `index.html` – The main page containing sections for Home, About, Clones, and Contact.
- `style.css` – Stylesheet providing a dark cosmic theme and responsive layout.
- `logo.png` – The Mile High Motherplants logo (transparent background). 

## Hosting Instructions (GitHub Pages)

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Sign in to GitHub or create a free account.
   - Click the “New” button to create a new repository. Name it something like `mile-high-motherplants`.

2. **Upload Website Files**
   - Drag and drop the contents of this folder (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `logo.png`) into the repository or use the GitHub web editor to upload them.
   - Commit the files to the `main` branch.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Navigate to the repository’s **Settings**.
   - Select **Pages** from the side menu.
   - Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and the `/root` directory, then click **Save**. GitHub will provide a URL where your site will be hosted.

4. **Set a Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Purchase your desired domain (e.g., `milehighmotherplants.com`) from a domain registrar such as Namecheap or GoDaddy.
   - In the domain’s DNS settings, create a `CNAME` record pointing to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `yourusername.github.io`). Refer to GitHub’s documentation for exact details.

5. **Visit Your Live Site**
   - After a few minutes, your website should be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL and at your custom domain (once DNS updates).

## Customization

- Edit `index.html` to update the text, clone descriptions, and contact details.
- Modify `style.css` to adjust the color palette, layout, or typography.
- Replace `logo.png` with your final logo design if you wish to use a different version.

Enjoy your new website!
